# FreeCodeCamp RPG Project

## Description
A simple text-based Role-Playing Game (RPG) built as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.  
Players can create characters, battle enemies, and progress through a short adventure.

## Live Demo
https://crackedphos.github.io/Role-Playing-Game/

## Features
- Character creation  
- Turn-based combat  
- Enemy encounters  
- Player stats (health, attack, etc.)  
- Win or lose conditions  

## Technologies Used
- HTML – Structure of the game interface  
- CSS – Styling and layout  
- JavaScript – Game logic and interactivity  

## How to Play
1. Open the project in your browser.  
2. Create your character and follow the on-screen instructions.  
3. Choose actions to fight enemies and survive.  
4. Win by defeating all opponents or lose if your health reaches zero.  

## What I Learned
While building this project, I gained practical experience in both programming and game development concepts, including:

### 1. JavaScript Fundamentals
- Implemented variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements to manage game logic.  
- Learned how to break down a problem into smaller, manageable tasks for coding.

### 2. DOM Manipulation & Event Handling
- Dynamically updated HTML elements to reflect player stats, inventory, and combat outcomes.  
- Used event listeners to capture player actions, like attacking or buying items.

### 3. Objects & Arrays
- Represented game entities such as players, enemies, and shop items using objects.  
- Managed collections of items, enemies, and player stats efficiently using arrays.

### 4. Randomization & Probability
- Used `Math.random()` to create randomized combat damage, enemy encounters, and item drops.  
- Learned to balance probabilities to make gameplay fair and challenging.

### 5. Game State Management
- Tracked player progress, health points, inventory, and experience throughout the game.  
- Learned to maintain and update state consistently to prevent bugs.

### 6. Debugging & Testing
- Identified and fixed logical errors such as negative health, invalid inventory updates, and infinite loops.  
- Learned the importance of testing different game scenarios for smooth gameplay.

### 7. Game Design Principles
- Designed turn-based combat and branching player choices for engagement.  
- Learned how to pace challenges, level progression, and rewards to create a satisfying gameplay loop.

### 8. UI & UX Design
- Built an interface that clearly displays information to the player.  
- Learned how feedback (like health changes or battle outcomes) affects player experience.

### 9. Modular Coding Practices
- Organized code into reusable functions to improve readability and maintainability.  
- Learned the value of keeping game logic separate from UI updates.

### 10. Creativity & Problem-Solving
- Developed storytelling elements, quests, and encounters.  
- Learned to think creatively to enhance the game experience while solving programming challenges.
